    <h3> About Me </h3>
            <p> I am an Agile Web Developer student at ProjectCodex , a computer training school in Cape Town. I am on a journey of learning how to develop
                softwares using code. I am dedicated to my work, optimistic and hard working. 
                I am open to learning new skills every day and gain more knowledge in things that I do. I get my work done whenever I put my mind to it, 
                and I love challenges because they make me realize my capabilities to solve problems. I recently started creating projects using HTML,CSS and JavaScript 
                and I am getting better at it every day
